This is extremely easy to install and requires no coding.
VQMod is required for this to work, if you wish to install it without VQMod please download version 1.0.
If you are unsure please email opencartplus@gmail.com for a free installation service.


INSTALLATION:

1. Upload the file name ocp_currency_dropdown.xml to YOUR_OPENCART_ROOT/vqmod/xml/


Check your store and you will see a nice smooth drop-down menu to change currencies :)
